Giant Electronic Calculator
Completes First Calculation
at Armoured Corps

Date: February 14, 1946

Philadelphia - This morning at the Moore School of
Electrical Engineering, a massive new machine known as
the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer
(ENIAC) has successfully completed its first full
computation for the United States Army’s Ballistics

Research Laboratory.

Officials report that the machine performed the artillery-trajectory calculation in
mere minutes—a task that would have required hours of manual work. The army hopes that
this speed will revolutionise wartime computing and permit far more rapid fire-control
table production. Still, the machine is not yet a general-purpose computer: it must be
rewired manually for each new problem, and designers say reliability remains a concern
given the tremendous power consumption and heat generated.

Professor Eckert commented that “we are at the threshold of a new age of computing
machines,” and that within the next decade smaller and more efficient computers may
well enter commercial and academic use. For now, however, ENIAC represents a
significant leap in scientific and military calculation capability—proof-positive that
the “electronic brain” may soon become reality.

Many scientists believe that this machine heralds not just faster calculations, but a
fundamental shift in how problems will be solved in engineering and science.
